<h3>Main Text: </h3>   
<i>Abstract Algebra</i>, David Dummit and Richard Foote, 3rd edition. 

<h3> Prerequisites: </h3>  Math 7751 and an undergraduate course in linear algebra comparable in level to UVA 4651.
<br>



<h3> Course content </h3>  The course will consist of 3 main parts:
<ul>
<li> Modules and advanced linear algebra (approximately 4 weeks). 
<li> Representations theory of finite groups (approximately 4 weeks). 
<li> field and Galois theory (approximately 6 weeks).
</ul>

The material in the first part will be taken primarily from Chapters 10-12 of Dummit and Foote (DF). More specifically, the plan is to cover 10.4, the entire Chapter 12 and parts of 11.5, time permitting.  I will assume familiarity with the content of Sections 11.1-11.4 as this material is discussed in standard undergraduate linear algebra and Sections 10.1-10.3 which were covered in Algebra-I in Fall 25. The relevant DF chapters for the second part are 18 and 19; however, we may not be using DF for representation theory. Finally, the material on field theory and Galois theory we will cover is mostly discussed in Chapters 13-14 of DF, though our order of my exposition will be quite different. The current plan is to cover 13.1, 13.2, 13.4, 13.5, parts of 13.6, 14.1-14.4 and parts of 14.5 and 14.6.

<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final,
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 30% 
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 30%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The format of the exams has not been finalized at this point, but most likely the final and the first midterm 
will be in-class while the second midterm will be take-home.
The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed (in case the exam is held in class).
<ul>
<li> First midterm exam: Thu, Feb 19 of Thu, Feb 26
<li> Second midterm exam: Thu, Apr 2 or Thu, Apr 9
<li> Final exam: Fri, May 1st, 9am-noon
</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups or extensions (for take-home exams) will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as

serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission

for a make-up (resp. extension) before the exam (resp. due date). </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam

by the due date without a compelling reason, you will

be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 

<li> Homework will be assigned weekly
<li> Homework should be submitted electronically on Canvas. Please submit the entire homework as a single pdf and (if you original work is handwritten) make sure the file is readable; you are strongly encouraged to use scanning software (or a scanner) instead of making photos of individual pages.
<li>    No late homework will be accepted. However, two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
<li>    GRADING: it may not be possible to grade all homework problems. 
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
<b>you should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution</b>. As a general rule, no use of AI is allowed.

<li> On take-home exams: you MAY NOT discuss problems with other people
or use any resources (including web) except for the class textbook, your
class notes and materials posted on the course page (on github) or the course canvas site. 
You may ask me questions about the exam problems, but normally
I will only provide very brief hints. 
</ul>




<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Monday, January 26 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Tuesday, January 27 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Wednesday, March 11 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>


<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
