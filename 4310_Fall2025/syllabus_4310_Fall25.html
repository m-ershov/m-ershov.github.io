</ul>
<h3> References </h3> 
There will be no official main text. Parts of the following 4 books will be used for different parts of the course.
<ul>
<li><i>Real Mathematical Analysis</i>,  Charles Pugh, second edition, corrected printing. </h4> Available electronically through UVA subscription 
<li><i>Real Analysis II</i>,  Terrence Tao, second edition, fourth edition. </h4> Available electronically through UVA subscription 
<li><i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i>,  Walter Rudin, third edition.
<li><i>Introductory Real Analysis, </i>  A. N. Kolmogorov and S. V. Fomin, revised English edition. 
</ul>

<h3> Prerequisites </h3> 
<ul>
<li> 1. You should have taken MATH 3310 (Basic Real Analysis) or equivalent. The most essential
skill from 3310 that is crucial in 4310 is being able to work with the epsilon-delta
definition of the limit and related notions like convergence and continuity (just formally 
understanding the definition of the limit is not enough).

<li> 2. As with most 4000 level math classes, you are expected to have substantial prior exposure to proofs. 
You should be completely comfortable  with basic proof techniques  and have experience in both reading (and understanding) proofs and writing your own proofs. 
</ul>


<h3> Course outline </h3>
The main goal of the course is to develop basic notions of mathematical analysis (convergence,
continuity, compactness etc.) in the setting of metric spaces. The material in the first half of the course
will have some overlap with that of 3310; however, almost everything will be done in greater
depth and generality. The second half will cover topics that you most 
likely have not studied before, including convergence in function spaces, fixed point theorems and
Lebesgue integration. We will not be following any of the above books very closely, but I hope to cover the majority of topics 
from chapters 1,2 and 4 from Pugh's book and some parts of chapters 3 and 6. 
The book `Introductory Real Analysis' by Kolmogorov and Fomin will likely be the main
reference for Lebesque integration (roughly the last three weeks of the semester).
<br>

<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final,
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 30% 
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 30%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The format of the exams has not been finalized at this point, but most likely the final and the first midterm 
will be in-class while the second midterm will be take-home.
The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed (in case the exam is held in class).
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Wed, Oct 1st 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Wed, Nov 5th

  <li> Final exam: Fri, Dec 12th, 2-5pm (the date could be changed in the case of a take-home final)

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups or extensions (for take-home exams) will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as

serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission

for a make-up (resp. extension) before the exam (resp. due date). </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam

by the due date without a compelling reason, you will

be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 

<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursdays
<li> Homework should be submitted electronically on Canvas. Please submit the entire homework as a single pdf and (if you original work is handwritten) make sure the file is readable; you are strongly encouraged to use scanning software (or a scanner) instead of making photos of individual pages.
<li>    No late homework will be accepted. However, two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
<li>    GRADING: it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. In each assignment 3-4 selected (but not announced in advance) problems will be graded for credit. 
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
<b>you should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution</b>. As a general rule, no use of AI is allowed.

<li> On take-home exams: you MAY NOT discuss problems with other people
or use any resources (including web) except for the class textbook and your
class notes. You may ask me questions about the exam problems, but normally
I will only provide very brief hints. 
</ul>




<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Tuesday, September 9 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Wednesday, September 10 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Tuesday, October 21 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>


<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
